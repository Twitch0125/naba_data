# Ratings project. Status: not implemented

## Overview

- Allows Admins to upload OOTP CSVs of player ratings which the app will then
  scale to 20-80 scale and allow participants to view their players' ratings.
- Allows participants to create batting/pitching lineups with visible ratings.
  Participants could then send screenshots of the lineups to an Admin who shall
  update the participant's team.

## Helpers
There is some example CSV files in [example_data/](./example_data/) that you can use to understand what kind of data this app will be working with.

## Implementation overview
to be created...
We'll need a table of logical chunks to work on. LLMs should update this table when progress is made.
